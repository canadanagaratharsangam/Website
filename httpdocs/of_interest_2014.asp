The function was organized by Shanti Suppiah, Lakshmee Annamalai and Sindhu Suppiah. Dr. Valliappan and Mr. Annamalai distributed the elzhais to all the families who attended the event. In total 110 ezhais were distributed. Our current President Mr. Suppiah provided a year-end update on the finances of this comittee and vote of thanks. Afterwards, a Yelam (Auction) was conducted by Mr.V Pal, in which $22,030 was raised to support the CNS education fund. Several members also donated money towards the education fund. Thanks to everyone for their generous contribution. Pot-luck dinner was served. Photos of this event have been posted to the 'Photos' section within this page.</p>

                                            Not long after most of the families arrived, the men got right to work to cut vegetables (namely, egg plant, plantain, pumpkin, and jackfruit) for some of the Padaippu dishes.<p>

                                        <p>Also in the morning, some of the elders washed and hung to dry a new Vesthi and Saree. These two items of clothing will symbolize our ancestors during the evening prayer.</p>

                                        <p>Later, the ladies made the dishes for the Padaippu. To start the cooking, a conch shell, or "Sangu", was blown. Some explanations of the dishes are included for readers not familiar with them. They were: </p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><b>Karupatti Paniyaram</b> (also known as <b>Padaippu Paniyaram</b>), which is a deep-fried, sweet flat-shaped dumpling made of karupatti or "black jagerry" (jaggery made from Palm wine) Kantharapam is similar, but is made with regular jaggery (vellam, in Tamil).
												<li><b>Paal Choru</b>
                                            (translated as "milk rice") which is a sweet rice with a porridge-like consistency. It is also cooked using karupatti. Chakara pongal is similar, but is made with regular jaggery.
												<li><b>Marakarikai Dosa</b>, or dosa made from dhal.
												<li><b>Katharikai</b> (egg plant) and <b>Valakai</b> (plantain) <b>kulambu</b>
                                            (curried "sauce")
												<li><b>Parankikai</b> (pumpkin) <b>kulambu</b>
                                            <li><b>Palakai</b> (jackfruit) <b>kootu</b>
                                            (not as curried or as "liquidy" as kulambu)
                                        </ul>

                                        <p>Although not required, other dishes were made:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>
                                            Vadai (savoury, deep-fried "fritter"), appalam (known as Papadam outside of South India), and cabbage poriyal (fried cabbage).
                                        </ul>

                                        <p>
                                            In preparation for the evening prayer, the washed and dried Vesthi and Saree were folded and placed on the altar, along with garlands, a Rudraksha Maalai (a garland of prayer beads made from Rudraksha
												seeds), jasmine flowers, and jewels.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>Mr. Visvanathan Chettiar of Konapet helped with the "Pallayam", or the serving of the food on three banana leaves, in front of the altar.</p>

                                        <p>Once altar and offerings were prepared, around 6 o'clock in the evening, everyone gathered in the prayer room.</p>

                                        <p>We began with our traditional bhajans and slokas, and after singing, we observed a period of silence to remember our ancestors.</p>

                                        <p>With the event complete, dinner was served with the previously offered food, that was quite delicious.</p>

                                        <p>We hope the next generation of Nagarathars in Canada will continue with this tradition that was started.</p>

                                        <p>What a lovely time we had for Mother's Day, 2014 at Northwood Community Centre.</p>

                                        <p>There, we celebrated the day in honour of all moms, who's tireless work may sometimes, maybe even most times, not be appreciated by the rest of the family!</p>

                                        <p>Mother's day is a society's way of saying "thank you" to moms.</p>

                                        <p>Did you know that the celebration of Mother's day actually began in Land of the Free, the United States, in the early 20th century? The year was 1905, to be exact, when Anna Jarvis, a pacifist, campaigned to create a day to honour her mom, and all moms, with a national holiday. Three years later, her wish started to become true as Jarvis' home state of West Virginia made it a holiday. Finally, in 1914, President Woodrow Wilson signed a document proclaiming the 2nd Sunday in May as Mother's Day, and we've been celebrating it ever since.</p>

                                        <p>In appreciation of CNS moms, our dads took part in the Mother's Day cooking contest, with the winner being Annamalai (and Banu) who made the amazing vegetable fried rice, and runner-up being Subi, who made the delicious aviyal. Congratulations and thanks to the winners and participants.</p>

                                        <p>Even though Mother's Day 2014 is long past, we should try to find more opportunities to honour our moms.</p>

                                        <p>The older children gave informative talks on how to "save our earth", in the spirit of Earth Day coming on April 22nd.</p>

                                        <p>A surprise dance by the ladies entertained us.</p>

                                        <p>With a final prayer to Lord Muruga after being fully ornamented, we all went down to dining hall and enjoyed a delicious meal provided by the Temple.</p>
