<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><b>CARING YOUR TEETH IS A LIFE LONG 
COMMITMENT</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">As stated by Canadian 
Dental Association, “taking proper care of your teeth and gums is a lifelong 
commitment.” It includes a good oral hygiene routine that you follow at home, as 
well as regular visits to your dentist and an overall &quot;team&quot; approach to your 
oral care. By taking these simple steps, there's every reason why you should 
keep your teeth &quot;good for life&quot;.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;In this regard, for the 
benefit of every one I intend discussing certain aspects of dental care in a 
question and answer style</span>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><i><span style="font-family:Arial">Why are my teeth 
sensitive?</span></i></b><span style="font-family:Arial"><br>
Sensitivity may be due to dental decay in the teeth, exposed root surfaces, 
broken old fillings, chipped tooth, accumulations of plaque and tartar. Proper 
treatment should solve the problem.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family:Arial">Why are my teeth 
stained?</span></b><span style="font-family:Arial"><br>
Stains may be due to fluorosis or intake of tetracycline during pregnancy which 
may affect a baby's teeth, hypoplastic enamel, tobacco and coffee (or) tea 
usage, improper brushing and flossing. Treatment : some stains are removed by 
scaling and polishing. Fluoride or Tetracycline stains are normally veneered to 
look aesthetically better. Bleaching helps in some cases depending on the type 
and severity of the problem. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><i><span style="font-family:Arial">Why does bad odour 
(Halitosis) in the mouth occur?</span></i></b><span style="font-family:
Arial"><br>
Bad odour may be caused by gingivitis (gum disease) or periodontitis, bleeding 
gums, breathing through the mouth, extensive tooth decay with periapical 
abscess. Treatment: Regular/periodic checkup, scaling with the dentist, proper 
brushing and flossing.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family:Arial">Why do I get mouth 
ulcers?</span></b><span style="font-family:Arial"><br>
Mouth ulcers may be due to sharpness in the teeth, cheek-biting habits, due to 
vitamin deficiency, viral infections and other unknown reasons.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family:Arial">Why do teeth hurt?</span></b><span style="font-family:
Arial"><br>
Teeth may hurt due to mobility of the tooth, extensive decay where the nerves 
are exposed, trauma to the tooth and wisdom teeth eruptions. Visit the dentist 
for appropriate treatment.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family:Arial">When do I loose my baby 
teeth?</span></b><span style="font-family:Arial"><br>
Baby teeth normally start to fall from age 5 to 13 years. Totally twenty baby 
teeth will be lost.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family:Arial">Why do I have a space 
between the upper front teeth?<br>
</span></b><span style="font-family:Arial">This is called diastema commonly due 
to thick tissue between the two front teeth. The treatment recommended is that 
this thick tissue should be surgically removed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family:Arial">Is it possible to 
straighten the teeth and jaws ?</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Yes It is possible and 
there are different kinds of appliances to straighten the teeth and jaws.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">1. Habits breaking 
appliances: These are used to break the habits like tongue thrusting or thumb 
sucking. We can do the fixed or removable appliance for this.<br>
2. Space mainteners: This is done if a baby molars are removed when the patient 
is 6 to 8 yrs of age to maintain the space for the eruption of permanent 
premolars, again there are different kinds of space mainteners available as 
fixed and removable types.<br>
3. Removable Dental arch expansion appliance:<br>
This is performed when there is posterior crossbite, to expand the arch whether 
single tooth (or) more teeth and to correct the occlusion<br>
4. Twin Block appliance: This is done when the patients lower jaw is small and 
under <br>
developed , to move the lower jaw in front, again this is the removable 
appliance.<br>
5. Head Gears: This is given to move the upper jaw inside with constant pressure 
.This appliance is worn 14 Hrs a day</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family:Arial">Could you tell something about fixed 
braces?</span></i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">Yes. This treatment is known as orthodontic 
treatment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are 3 Phases in orthodontic treatment. Phase I - Mixed 
Dentition Phase: In this the patients are 10 -13 years of age. They do have some 
of the baby teeth. This treatment takes more time and duration. It can be 
treated without removing the permanent teeth if the jaw is in proper proportion. 
Phase II - Early Permanent Dentition Phase: In this the patients are over 14 and 
upto 25 years of age. They have all permanent teeth. Phase III - Adult 
orthodontics is over 25 years of age. Sometimes the braces are combined with 
some removable appliances. After braces normally in 18 - 24 months the patients 
will be wearing removable retainers for another year as a retentive phase.</span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family:Arial">&nbsp;How about Gum 
diseases?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></i></b>
</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial">We shall see below some specific gum 
diseases.</span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family:Arial">About Gingivitis</span></i></b><i><span style="font-family:Arial"> 
- Causes:</span></i> <span style="font-family:Arial">Inflamation of the gum 
around the teeth mainly caused by bacteria in the oral cavity along with 
improper oral hygiene - conditions - Gum's tendency to bleed.</span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family:Arial">About Periodontitis</span></i></b><i><span style="font-family:Arial">:</span></i><span style="font-family:Arial"> 
When gingivitis is prolong without treatment it leads to periodontitis. 
[periodontal ligament joins the teeth to the bone] that results in loosening and 
mobility of the teeth. This condition grades from 1 to 3.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">Treatment<b>:</b> Regular recall scaling and 
proper oral hygiene instructions should be given by the dentist and hygienist.</span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family:Arial">What are the ways to replace missing 
teeth?</span></i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">The missing teeth, which were extracted due 
to failure of rootcanal (or) mobility (or) fractures, can be replaced with 
different kinds.</span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:Arial">1.</span></b><span style="font-family:Arial">
<b>Dental Implants</b>: There are different kinds of Implants available depends 
on the patients jaw bone. This is determined depending on the number of teeth to 
be replaced. The Implants can also be used in the complete restoration of the 
upper and lower dentitions.<br>
<b>2. Complete upper and lower dentures</b>: In this case there is no teeth 
present in the patients mouth it is restored with removable upper and lower full 
dentures.<br>
<b>3. Partial upper and lower Dentures</b>: In this case there are one or more 
missing teeth it can be restored with either Acrylic Removable partial dentures 
or cast metallic removable partial dentures.<br>
<b>4. Fixed Bridges</b>: In this case there are one or more missing teeth. It is 
replaced with fixed bridges. The tooth in front and back of the missing place is 
crowned and the bridges are done. This is done with full ceramics or ceramics 
fused with metal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">The treatment is determined according to 
individual patients depending on their needs, esthetics, functional and 
financial desirement.</span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family:Arial">What are rootcanals and endodontics?</span></i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">These services are rendered for a tooth 
decayed that has exposed nerve inside the tooth. The common symptoms are 
shooting pain after trigger with air (or) hot and cold substances on the tooth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">Rootcanal is removal of the exposed nerves in 
the tooth. Depends on the tooth the numbers of nerves vary. First stage for this 
is the removal of the nerves and then shaping of the canal and the final stage 
is filling the nerve space and tooth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">Root Canal of the dead tooth:<br>
(a) Root Canal is performed in this case due to fracture (or) trauma to the 
tooth and the patient unawareness and carelessness that leads to the nerve 
inside the tooth to become dead and the tooth starts to change color.<br>
(b) Patient negligence of the decayed tooth for long time leads to infection 
around the roots making the tooth dead.</span></p>
