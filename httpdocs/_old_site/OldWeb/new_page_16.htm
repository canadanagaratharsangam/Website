<span style="font-size:14.0pt">BREAST CANCER</span></u></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><u>Introduction</u></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Cancer of breast is one of the most prevalent cancers in 
women. It can run in families. Early detection is important to treat adequately. 
It does not cause symptoms in the early stages in some patients and hence 
routine examination of breast and screening are needed particularly in high risk 
patients.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><u>Facts about Breast Cancer</u></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In Canada I in 9 women will develop breast cancer in her 
lifetime.3% of breast cancers occur in men. Death rate has not changed over the 
last 20 years.75% all breast lumps either cancerous or non cancerous are 
diagnosed by self breast examination. 8 out of ten are not cancerous. 70% of 
women diagnosed with breast cancer have no known risk factors. Smallest 
cancerous lump of 2 to 3mm carries one billion cells.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><u>Risks of Breast cancer</u></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Breast cancer like any other form of cancer can affect any 
woman. Risk of breast cancer is increased in women aged 50 and above. Family 
history of breast cancer particularly in both breasts carries a high risk. Six 
times greater risk if ones’ mother or sister had breast cancer before menopause. 
Ten times greater risk if ones mother or sister had cancer in both the breasts. 
Other conditions contributing to the risk include early onset of menarche (first 
menstrual period), women with no children, and women who had pregnancy at an 
advanced age. Obesity and smoking also increases the risk. There is a minimal 
risk after taking hormone replacement therapy for 4 years.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><u>Symptoms</u></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Lump in the breast is an alarming situation to any woman. 
Not all lumps are cancerous. Women can get lumps during and around menstrual 
period. Some young women can develop benign lumps. Since early detection can 
lead to maximal cure it is important to know the ways to identify it. There are 
three simple ways.</p>
<ol style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" start="1" type="1">
  <li class="MsoNormal">Self Breast examination: Ask your doctor, pharmacist or 
  the nearby hospital breast screening clinic for a leaflet about breast self 
  examination. Examination can be done once a month while in shower with soap 
  hand 4<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> day after the menstrual period. Look and 
  observe in the mirror for any difference in the nipples regarding size shape 
  or skin dimpling. Any discharge from the nipple particularly blood should be 
  reported to your physician and investigated. </li>
</ol>
<ol style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" start="2" type="1">
  <li class="MsoNormal">Annual Physical examination by your physician.</li>
</ol>
<ol style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" start="3" type="1">
  <li class="MsoNormal">Mammogram at the nearby breast screening clinic. 
  Mammogram is a simple X-ray of the breast which can detect the cancer most of 
  the time at a very early age. At most of the screening clinics in Ontario a 
  nurse examiner will clinically conduct breast exam as well.</li>
</ol>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in"><i><u>Mammogram schedule as per 
age:</u></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in">40-49—According to Physician and 
patient discrepancy </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in">50-74---Once in 2 years</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in">Over 74- Usually not needed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in">If there is a family history then 
mammogram should be done at least 5years before the earliest age of onset.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in"><b><u>Treatment</u></b>: Once 
confirmed by biopsy (Piece of breast excised and examined under microscope) the 
treatment could be either surgery, radiation chemotherapy or a combination of 
these three. Surgery could be removal of lump or the breast with or without the 
lymph nodes. Radiation after surgery or as a palliative measure can be 
performed. Chemotherapy is giving courses of anticancer drugs. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in"><b><u>Conclusion</u></b>: <b><i>
Early detection is important. It should be strongly emphasized that everywoman 
need to do self exam or undergo screening particularly if there is a strong 
family history of breast cancer present. If not detected early it can spread to 
many parts of the body and shorten the life expectancy. Most of Asian woman feel 
shy to discuss personal problems even with their own physicians. Please try to 
find a woman physician and tell them the problem so that investigation and 
treatment can be started early</i></b></p>
