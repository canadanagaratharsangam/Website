<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: -2; margin-bottom: -2">

<p class="MsoNormal">Pattinathaar was born with silver spoon in the mouth to an 
opulent businessman in kaveripoompattinam around 14<sup>th</sup> century A.D. As 
per NAGARATHAR tradition he carried out business successfully and was 
accumulating his family wealth in leaps and bounds. He got married at 
appropriate time of those days. He adopted a divine child through the blessings 
of Lord Shiva.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">He realized his soul and the reason of his birth through 
the deed of his son. One day his son left the house leaving a box. The box 
contained an eyeless needle and note in palm leaf. The inscription in the leaf 
read “KAathatra Oosium kadiku VAarathu KAan”. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The verse kindled a catalytic reaction in his soul. He left 
the acquired wealth and took Sanyasam. He traveled through Tamilnadu and 
Calcutta pilgrimaging to Saiva Shrines.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">His writings were born out of this soul searching journey.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">His teachings cover a wide range of topics of human life. 
It is impossible to cover all in a nutshell. I will touch upon salient points. 
When I started reading his lyrics I was as ignorant as the bird that perch on 
telegraph wire not knowing the importance of the message that passes through it. 
After repeated reading my mental horizon has widened. I will share some of the 
facts with the readers of Nagarathars.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Mother is respected in every religion and community. 
Without mother there is no existence. Pattinathaar compiled a sonnet at the 
death of his mother. “THAaYAaRUKKU THAGANA ANJALI”.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Aiyirandu thingalAai angamellam nonthu petru</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Payalendra pothae parintheduthu seyyaeru</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Akipurathilaenthi kanaga mulai thanthaAli</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Eppirapil KAanben eni</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Most of the pregnancies we see in daily life end happily 
with the delivery of a child. The mother undergoes innumerable suffering during 
the ten month period. The baby is born out of active suffering taken as pleasure 
by the great mother. During the ten month the SISU not only drains the physical 
energy of the MAatha but exhausts her mentally by focusing her attention only 
towards her child. She does not get any material pleasure during this period. 
Her goal is set and meditates like a YOGI in Penance. Yogi attains GaNAM at the 
end of his TAPAS. Similarly the child is deliverd at the end of this ten month 
YOGAM. Hence in Tamil thesaurus one of the names for son is GaNAM.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In social life child is born out of union of male and 
female energy and in Yogic life GAnam is born out of spark created by bringing 
together the IDA and PINGALA nAadis.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If there is any other birth will I see this Mother?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">ManayAalum Makkalum Valvum dhanamum than vAayil mate</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">InamAana sutram mayAanamate vazikethuthunai</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">thinyaAm azavellalavaginumunbu seitha thavam</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">thaniyAala endrum paralOogam sithukum sathyame</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Once the soul departs from this body no one accompanies it 
to the cemetery. The relatives are up to the dwelling place. The wife comes up 
to the end of the road and the son comes up to the burial ground. Only your 
deeds of good nad evil are carried with you.&nbsp; Our Kannadhasan extrapolated this 
anthology in one of his film songs “Veeduvarai uravu,,,,.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Similarly the same concept is reflected in Grays ELEGY in a 
country churchyard. (Thomas Gray was an English poet and ELEGY is funeral song)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">“Can storied urn or animated bust</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; Back to its mansion the fleeting breadth</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Can honors voice provoke the silent dust</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Or flattery soothe the dull cold ear of death”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In an another sonnet that begins as “Oru mada MAathu,,,,&nbsp;&nbsp; 
He describes the life cycle of human birth to death. He stars from the time soul 
gets merged with the sperm of man. He describes the passion we undergo at 
various stages of life. He elaborates the sufferings we undergo at the fag end 
of our life. Step by step he elevates and depresses our mood. One need lot of 
endurance to read his poems. Some may think that it contains lot of pessimism.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The depth of philosophical meanings in His poems will make 
thoughts reverberate and sleep will be kept at bay like it did to Hamlet, prince 
of Denmark in Shakespeare.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I conclude with the soliloquy of Hamlet “No poppy nor 
mandragora nor all the drowsy syrups in the world will bring sleep which though 
owes yesterday”</p>
