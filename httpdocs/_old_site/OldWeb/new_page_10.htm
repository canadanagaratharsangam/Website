<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><b>How to get better results in <i>less</i> Time!</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The bad news is time flies; the good news is you are the 
pilot. Do not say you do not have enough time. You have exactly the same number 
of hours per day that were given to Mother Teresa, Leonardo da Vinci and Albert 
Einstein.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Let me narrate you a story, which I read recently. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Time Management Guru stood in front of the group of 
high powered overachievers and said, “Okay, time for a quiz.” He pulled out a 
one-gallon, wide-mouthed Mason jar and set it on a table in front of him. Then 
he produced about a dozen fist-sized rocks and carefully placed them, one at a 
time, into the jar. When the jar was filled to the top and no more rocks would 
fit inside, he asked, “Is this jar full?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Every one in the class said, “Yes”.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;“Really?” he said reaching under the table and pulling out 
a bucket of gravel. Then he dumped some gravel in and shook the jar causing 
pieces of gravel to work themselves down into spaces between the big rocks. He 
smiled and asked the group once more, “Is this jar full?” </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">By this time the class was onto him, “Probably not,” one of 
them answered. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">“Good!” he replied and reached under the table once again. 
This time, he brought out a bucket of sand and started dumping the sand in and 
around all the spaces left between the rocks and the gravel. Once more, he asked 
the question “Is this jar full?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;“No!” the class shouted. “Good!” he grabbed a pitcher of 
water and began to pour it in until the jar was filled to the brim. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Then he looked up at the class and asked, “What is the 
point of this illustration?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One student raised his hand and said, “The point is, no 
matter how full your schedule is, if you try really hard, you can always fit 
some more things in it!”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;“No,” replied the speaker, “that’s not the point. The 
truth this illustration teaches us is: If you don’t put the big rocks in first, 
you’ll never get them in at all.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In our life also, there are urgent and not urgent matters; 
there are important and not important matters. If we do not know to distinguish 
them, it is not possible to achieve better results in less time.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Undergoing a heart surgery, meeting a deadline or repairing 
a broken machine—all are good examples of urgent as well as important matters. 
Do them first.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Interruptions, phone calls and some meetings may be urgent 
but not important.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Building a relationship, certain prevention measures, 
planning—all may be important but not urgent.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Junk mails, gossiping and other time wasters may be 
unimportant as well as not urgent.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Urgent tasks have short-term consequences while important 
tasks have long term, goal related implications. Do the right things right. 
Noted management expert, Peter Drucker says, “doing the right thing is more 
important than doing things right. Doing the right things is effectiveness; 
doing things, right is efficiency. &nbsp;First focus should be on effectiveness and 
then on efficiency.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Do you know Pareto principle or the 80:20 Rule?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It says that 80 % of results are achieved with only 20 % of 
effort. In other words, a small proportion of activity generates non – scalar 
returns so frequently. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now let me give you some more tips to achieve better 
results in less time.</p>
<ol style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" start="1" type="1">
  <li class="MsoNormal"><font face="Trebuchet MS">Always spend time to <b>plan and organize</b>. In fact, 
  if you fail to take time for planning, you are, in effect, planning to fail.</font></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal"><font face="Trebuchet MS">Set <b>SMART goals</b>-Goals that are <b>S</b>pecific,
  <b>M</b>easurable, <b>A</b>chievable, <b>R</b>ealistic and <b>T</b>ime bound.</font></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal"><font face="Trebuchet MS"><b>Prioritize </b>your<b> </b>time to concentrate on 
  those items that bring greatest rewards. Remember the Pareto principle. The 
  trick to prioritizing is to isolate and identify that valuable 20 percent. 
  Most important, stick to your priorities.</font></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal"><font face="Trebuchet MS"><b>Use a To Do list </b>to help you to do all essential 
  tasks in the right order. To do lists are very simple but very effective tool 
  to be in control over things and to avoid over burden of work. It is a method 
  of organizing yourself and a way of reducing stress. </font> </li>
  <li class="MsoNormal"><font face="Trebuchet MS"><b>Be flexible. </b>Interruptions and distractions are 
  bound to happen. Have time for them. Time Management experts suggest planning 
  only for just 50 % or less of one’s time to handle interruptions and the 
  unplanned “emergency”</font></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal"><font face="Trebuchet MS"><b>Never be in a hurry.</b> Leave enough time for things 
  you absolutely must do. Never over commit. Be kind to yourself. </font> </li>
  <li class="MsoNormal"><font face="Trebuchet MS"><b>Perfection </b>is desirable but not essential. 
  Perfection may lead to Procrastination.</font></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal"><font face="Trebuchet MS">Conquer<b> Procrastination </b>by proper planning. Break 
  your task into smaller bits and tackle only a manageable bit(s) at a time; 
  take a break and then resume your task, from the place you left earlier.<b>
  </b></font></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal"><font face="Trebuchet MS">Look at your priority list and <b>do not hesitate to say 
  “no”,</b> when it is required. By learning to say “no”, you will see how your 
  life gets easier.</font></li>
</ol>
<ol style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" start="10" type="1">
  <li class="MsoNormal"><font face="Trebuchet MS">Finally, do not forget to<b> reward yourself</b> for 
  your successes, however small it may be.</font></li>
</ol>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in">Time is Nature’s way of 
preventing everything from happening at once. By managing your time properly, 
you will have proper control over the sequence of events in your life. Better 
late than never.</p>
