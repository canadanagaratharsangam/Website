<p ALIGN="LEFT">Are you already making your maximum allowable RRSP 
contributions? Are you still looking for a tax shelter for some of your 
investment income? The federal government has acted to eliminate many tax 
shelters, but of those that remain, Universal life insurance with its tax 
sheltered reserve is quickly becoming attractive to many Canadians.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Universal life insurance is a flexible policy. Unlike 
traditional insurance policies which have fixed contractual premiums, Universal 
life policies allow you to deposit what you like (within limits), and to vary 
your deposit each year if you wish. There must always be enough money in the 
policy's reserve to pay that year's premiums for the &quot;pure insurance&quot; element, 
but the amount in excess of that &quot;risk charge&quot; becomes part of the policy's 
reserve, from which future premiums may be paid. This reserve earns interest, 
and that interest is completely tax sheltered as long as it remains within the 
plan and its buildup stays within certain limits set by the government. If you 
withdraw funds from this reserve during your lifetime, part or all of the funds 
withdrawn will be taxable, but if the funds remain within the policy until your 
death, they would form part of the taxfree death benefit payable to your heirs, 
escaping income tax completely. </p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">These funds may be of great importance in your financial plan. 
They can be invested to provide a source of income to your surviving spouse or 
other dependent family members. Alternatively, if you have substantial funds 
built up within your RRSPs, those proceeds can help pay income taxes arising on 
all remaining unspent RRSPs (which can be as high as 50%) that do not pass to a 
surviving spouse. There are other estate costs which arise on death, such as 
probate taxes or fees, legal fees, taxes on capital gains, and funeral costs.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">A valuable feature of Universal life policies is that the 
accruing investment earnings can be used to pay the risk charges for the 
insurance protection -- as the investment income is not taxed until and unless 
it is withdrawn from the policy, you are in essence paying your insurance costs 
with untaxed dollars. Some Universal life policies are structured so that both 
the insurance and the investment reserve pay out to a beneficiary on death. 
These are often used to offset increasing taxes payable on death, such as 
capital gains, or taxes on a growing RRSP portfolio.</p>
