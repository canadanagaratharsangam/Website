<p class="MsoNormal">Headache is a common problem. All of us experience headache 
one time or other in our life. Most of the headaches are benign. Some are life 
threatening and some cause chronic disability.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It is important to know the common features of these 
various headaches. Headaches persisting for a longer period leading to daily 
disability need to be investigated by a physician.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><u>Tension Headache</u></b>:&nbsp; This is common. It occurs 
mostly in the evening and relieved by sleep and relaxation. It is worsened by 
Stress, anxiety and pressure from work or family.&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the time it feels as 
if some one is tying a band across the forehead or a heavy weight is placed on 
top of head. Simple pain killers or various relaxation techniques will help.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><u>Migraine:</u></b> This is common in women. It can 
affect one or both sides of the head. It throbs with nausea and vomiting. Light, 
sound and smell can disturb these people. It may be associated with menstrual 
periods or precipitated by certain foods like chocolate, cheese or monosodium 
containing food substances. Some one in the family may have similar problem. It 
can vary during lifetime and may disappear after menopause or during pregnancy. 
Simple pain killers may relieve the pain in the beginning but if the frequency 
and severity increases specific medications are needed with the advice from your 
physician.</p>
