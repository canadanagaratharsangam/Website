<span style="font-size: 16.0pt">MOTHER</span></u></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Humans are emotional animals. Attachment, social life and 
empathy are the roots in all of us. This is the Love is Born. Deep emotional 
attachment between individuals happens in all of our life. The first Love all of 
us experience is that of our mother. If we can analyze the nature of bondage 
from conception perhaps we can have a minimal understanding of this relation.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Mother undergoes many hardships during pregnancy. Some of 
them risk their lives. Yet no woman abandons the role of mother. Even after the 
hardship of pregnancy and Labour she does go through another one subsequently. 
Anything you get after hard work gets attached firmly. The relation is here is 
between two souls. One came out of the blood and tissue of the other. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Even after birth rearing a child is a challenge. I am sure 
most of us have experienced that in full or in part during our lifetime. Here 
again Mother sacrifices many things for her so that her child will get the full 
benefit of this worldly pleasures. They do not eat till the son or daughter 
comes home even if it is late at night. This sacrifice is inborn to protect the 
child. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If one looks at the other side the child does not have that 
much fervor towards the mother. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The child takes it for granted that it is the duty of the 
mother to perform what she is doing. It takes long to realize the nature of 
Mother’s sacrifice. Once realized the truth attachment becomes tight. Emotions 
start to play once again between the mother and child. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The word mother itself gives a lot of meaning in various 
languages. AMMA, MUMMY, MA, and AMME: all of these in various languages mean the 
same. “IM” means the sound of MagAram in Tamil that is the one from Kundalini or 
Mooladhara Chakra. Aa means cow in Tamil. Cow means soul again in Tamil. As you 
can see the word mother in all languages means the delivery of the soul from the 
root of spine.&nbsp; Spiritually this is so important. Hence the value for the word 
mother is immeasurable</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Mother is the only soul to understand and appreciate the 
well being of her children. It is not possible to be born without the Mother and 
her mammoth sacrifice. It will be a real human gesture to appreciate her role. 
Such a wonderful day is Mother’s day. It does not end by giving flowers or 
gifts. Appreciation should come deep from the heart and soul of us. Hence let us 
pray for the well being of all MOTHERS in the world at this memorable day.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">“HAPPY MOTHERS DAY TO ONE AND ALL THE MOTHERS IN THE WORLD”</p>
