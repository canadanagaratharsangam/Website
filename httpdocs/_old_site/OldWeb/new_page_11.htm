<span style="font-size:14.0pt">Stroke</span></u></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Stroke is a devastating illness that strikes individuals 
with sudden onset. It disables the person to the maximum during the initial 
period. Recovery from it is gradual and varies from one person to another. A 
basic knowledge on stroke will help the person as well the family to understand 
and withstand the sudden calamity.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Stroke occurs when the blood supply to a part or parts of 
the brain are altered. The alteration could be too much blood supply to the area 
by means of rupture of the blood vessel (hemorrhagic stroke) or reduction in 
blood flow due to blockage of the tube </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">(Ischemic stroke). The blockage may be the result of blood 
clot from remote areas like heart or neck blood vessels (embolic stroke) or due 
to narrowing of the blood tube because of deranged cholesterol and clotting 
mechanism of the blood (thrombosis)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When stroke occurs the person can loose function of the 
part of the body supplied by the blood vessel.&nbsp; Hence the manifestation can vary 
depending on the parts involved. Usual symptoms are numbness, weakness of one 
half of the body. Speech swallowing and sometimes eyesight will be affected. 
Coma occurs in large area being affected or too much pressure manifesting due to 
blood and swelling.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Death occurs in a small percentage of people. Recovery 
varies from minimum to maximum. Recovery can be speeded effectively by adopting 
medical treatment during stroke period. This will be addressed by your 
physicians. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Prevention is very important in stroke. Few simple tasks 
may prevent a major tragedy.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Age sex and race are primary contributing factors for 
stroke. We cannot alter this natural selection. High blood pressure is the most 
important contributor to stroke. Monitoring it daily by electronic measurement 
or regular physician visit is important. Weight reduction and reducing salt 
intake and increasing potassium intake in diet will help to control the blood 
pressure besides the medication. Normal blood pressure depends on age and other 
coexisting illness like diabetes. A physician will be able to explain and guide 
you.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Control of diabetes and cholesterol are very important. 
Diet exercise and medications again will help along with a personal motivation. 
Smoking is a very important risk for stroke and heart attacks. Even after 
stopping smoking the risk can continue for 2 to 10 years. Second hand smoke from 
others in family or environment is also not good.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">People who smoke should think about family and look at 
others who had stroke. Do you want to suffer like that?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">NO. Then all you need is good balanced diet with low salt, 
&nbsp;low fat and high potassium.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Regular exercise of 20 minutes a day for three days in a 
week and maintaining a weight for age and height. &nbsp;Good control of diabetes, 
cholesterol and blood pressure to the recommended levels.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><u><span style="font-size:16.0pt">Nagarathars and Stroke</span></u></b>:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There is no study done Nagarathars regarding vascular 
problems. Anecdotal reports indicate that we have certain genetic predisposition 
to cardiovascular problems. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Sudden death in young age due to cardiac arrest or multiple 
ministrokes have been reported. We might have heard about young men dying of in 
sleep or waking up. Our great grandfathers and their fathers might have died 
suddenly. It is because of our genetic predisposition and our habits and diet. 
Back in Chettinad most of them eat food three or four times a day particularly 
in functions. There is not enough exercise for the food we consume. Sleep 
immediately after stroke is another bad habit. Overweight adds to the problem. 
The food eaten mostly involves oil or dairy product. Combination of all these 
factors lead to the complications mentioned above.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">High carbohydrate diet is needed in Hot climates and high 
protein diet needed in cold and temperate climates. We after migrating from 
extreme of climates have not changed. We still eat high carbohydrate diet 
including oil rich deep fried PANIYARAM, VADAIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It is time that we awake towards a healthy lifestyle for us 
and for our family</p>
