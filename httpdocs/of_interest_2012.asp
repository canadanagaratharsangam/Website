													<li>On Saturday December 22, 2012, CNS celebrated Pillayar Nonbu at the Northwood Community Centre in Toronto. The function was organized by Dr. Muthulakshmi and Dr. Aruna. The event officially began with Subi conducting the Bhajan, with both kids and adults participating. For the actual Pillayar Nonbu function, Mr. Manian, Dr. Valliappan, Dr. Kannappan, and Mr. Annamalai distributed the ellais to all the families attending. In total, 100 ezhais were given out. We also welcomed three new families who were joining us for the first time at Pillayar Nonbu. Afterwards, a Yelam, or auction, was conducted by V Pal in which over $13,000 was raised for the CNS Education Fund. For dinner, we were served pot-luck style, with a wide variety of traditional dishes. Thanks to everyone for their contribution!<br><br>
													Every two years, at the Pillayar Nonbu function, we choose new members to serve on the CNS committee. As such, we would like to thank V Pal and his committee for a job well done for the past two years and we welcome Mr. Suppiah, along with the <a href="office.asp">new committee members</a>, for the 2013-2014 term. Photos of the event, have been posted in the Photo's section of this page. Hope everyone is having a good holiday, and all the best for 2013 year!</li>

													<li>Nagarathars celebrated Deepavali on Saturday, Nov 17, at the Northwood Community Centre. Over 80 members attended this years event. The event started off with both kids and adults singing the national anthems of both Canada and India. This was followed by recital of Bharathiyar Padalgal by several children. Alagu and Sindhu Senthinathan entertained the audience with spectacular dance performances. Muthuraman gave a speech on teaching money management to children. Adults then participated in a 'Neeya Naana' style debate with Dr Yegappan performing the role of 'Gopinath'. The topic that was debated was about the challenges faced by parents in raising children. One section argued that raising children was difficult in the yesteryears whereas the others argued that it is difficult these days. It was a good debate, the only thing lacking was that no one expressed their points of view 'emotionally', like the original show. The final event of the night was an audio-visual quiz organized by Kannan Muthiah, our quiz master. Pot luck dinner was served at the end. CNS would like to thank the Social and Youth Committees, specifically Kannan Muthiah, as well as all voluteers who made this event a memorable one. Special thanks to Ramanathan Sethuraman who volunteered to act as the MC for the night. Photos of this event have been posted to the 'Photos and Video' section within this page.</li>

It was a joyous milestone, which was celebrated by family and friends. Dr. Valliappan gave a speech about his 50 years of happy married life. The grandchildren put together a grand show, consisting of skits, speeches, poems and dances for their grandparents and guests. There was a game for kids called "How well do you know Uncle & Aunty?" The couple's game was quite entertaining and hilarious. It was called "How well do you listen to your wife?" Then Dr. P. Valliappan and Mrs. Meena Valliappan cut the cake joined by their grandkids, after which a delicious lunch was served. All gifts were donated to Handicare International to sponsor a child in need. It was a fun filled afternoon enjoyed by all. Photos of this event have been posted to the 'Photos and Video' section within this page.</li>

													<li>Mother's Day was celebrated on Saturday May 19, 2012 at the Northwood Community Centre. <a href="images/hon_mr_justice_MKV.jpg"  rel="lightbox" title="Hon'ble Mr. Justice M Karpaga Vinayagam">Hon'ble Mr. Justice M Karpaga Vinayagam</a> was the Chief Guest at the event. He is the present Chairperson of the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity, Petroleum and Natural Gas in India, a position he has held since 2008. Justice Karpaga Vinayagam was a Judge of the Madras High Court from 1996 to 2006. He then served as Chief Justice of the Jharkhand High Court till retirement in May 2008. Justice Karpaga Vinayagam hails from Devakottai, Tamil Nadu.

													<br><br>In his hour long speech he honoured all mothers and spoke about the importance of virtues and living a moral life. He also spoke about several turning points in his life including his acquaintance with the late Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu Dr. M G Ramachandran, the impact Mohandas K. Gandhi's autobiography, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gandhi-An-Autobiography-Story-Experiments/dp/0807059099" target="_blank">The Story of My Experiments With Truth</a> had on him and last but not least the profound influence Sri Satya Sai Baba had on his life. He is an ardent devotee of Sri Sai Baba and strongly attributes His blessings and wishes as being the reasons for his intellectual and spiritual elevation in life.

													<br><br>The tradition continued this year. Lunch was cooked by the fathers and kids. Justice Karpaga Vinayagam was impressed with the quality and taste of the food and he jokingly commented that if this happens more often at home, the fathers will be able to further fine tune and master their cooking skills.

													<br><br>The Youth Committee sold roses at the event and was able to raise a small sum of money for the CNS Scholarship Fund. Kids and fathers took turns to express their appreciation and love for their mothers by saying a few words or reciting a poem. The final event of the day was a slideshow by Sathya and Kannan on the history of Mother's Day. Photos of this event have been posted to the 'Photos and Video' section within this page.</li>

													<li>Meena Palaniappan's Baby Shower was held at the Party Hall, 3504 Hurontario Road, Mississauga on Sunday, April 29, 2012. Solai Ramanathan organized this event. Guests started arriving at 11:00 AM and the event started at 12:00 noon. With Charulatha Mani's 'Seetha Kalyana Vaibhogame' playing in the background, achis took turns to apply turmeric on Meena's hands, kunkumam on her forehead, decked her with bangles, showered her with flowers and conveyed their best wishes and prayers for the new mom-to-be and baby. This was followed by a game for married couples and one for children. The adult game was similar to 'Kadhal Meter' on Vijay TV where married couples were tested on their compatibility with their spouses. The audience roared with laughter at some of the responses. Arthi Chinnameyyappan hosted a 'Who wants to be a millionaire' game for the kids. Meena cut the Baby Shower cake and lunch was then served. Most of the food items were ordered at restaurants and some of them were prepared by the achis. A few more games were conducted after lunch by Sathya Kannan and the mom-to-be Meena. Everyone had a blast! After coffee everyone said their good byes. Photos of this event have been posted to the 'Photos and Video' section within this page.</li>

													<li>The first CNS event of the year, the Tamil New Year function was held at Northwood Community Centre in Toronto on Saturday, April 21st. The event started off with a welcome speech by V Pal, our President. Several kids recited Thirukurals and provided their meaning. Sindhu and Lakshmee entertained the audience by dancing to a medley of bollywood and kollywood hits. Janani and Shanghavi did a fabulous job conducting a Jeopardy game for kids. The kids responses on a few of the topics were hilarious. They really surprised the adult audiences with their knowledge of movies. The adult audio-visual quiz came next. Chettiars and achis were divided into 2 groups and were quizzed on movies. Kannan Muthiah produced the game and was terrific as the quiz master. The final event of the evening was a patti mandram. Two groups debated on which age was the happiest in life - 20s or 60s. Annamalai Annan acted as the Naduvar. V Pal, Valli Kannan and Muthu argued that 20s was the best whereas Dr Yegappan, Ramanathan Sethuraman and Sathya Kannan argued that the 60s were the best. The arguments brought much laughter and enjoyment to the audience. Well done! More than 90 people attended this fun filled event. A fully catered dinner was served at the end. Thank you to all the performers and the CNS Social Committee for making this event a memorable one. Photos of this event have been posted to the 'Photos and Video' section within this page.</li>
