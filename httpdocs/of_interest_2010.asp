													<li>This year's Diwali function truly sparkled with all the entertainment and delicious food! The evening began with the Nagarathar kids ringing in this year's Diwali with a heartfelt bhajan song. This was followed by our very own robo creation, Shangavi, in her self-choreographed dance number. The dads then took over the dance floor in a high energy dance routine with their daughters, who later danced to a melody of new hits. The closing act to our dance entertainment was the moms' fashion show, where they put their glamorous outfits on display! All the teen and adult dance routines were choreographed by Sindhu Suppiah. Lastly, the group was entertained by Annamalai and Subi's comedy routine parodying our daily lives. The hungry audience and performers were satisfied with delicious dinner! The night was a great success, a big thanks to the Social Committee. Photos of this event have been posted to the 'Photos' section within this page.</li>

													<li><i>"Muruga literally means - The Beautiful One. Where there is beauty, love shines, and where there is love, truth radiates. When we seek the truth, we get freedom. Lord Muruga is a symbol of eternal youth, wisdom and liberation. Muruga is the essence of the Trinity. 'Mu' stands for Mukunda (Vishnu), 'Ru' for Rudra (Shiva), and 'Ka' for Kamala (Brahma), therefore Muruga represents the three divine functions - creation, protection and destruction."</i> - [<u>Source: Astroved.com</u>]. An abhishekam and homam was performed for Lord Muruga at the Hindu Temple in Richmond Hill on Friday, Oct 22, 2010. Several members attended this religious event that was paid for by CNS.</li>
													<li>150 excited ladies in one room and what do we have ... a Baby Shower for Shruti Suppiah on Saturday, October 16, 2010. This function was well represented by all communities including chettiars, punjabis and local friends. The guests enjoyed the traditional bangle ceremony, just that many of the ladies were very generous with applying kumkumam and chanthanam on her. Sindhu and Shanti did a great job organizing the games which was followed by a wonderful North and South Indian high tea. Credit goes to both moms for organizing this event. This was followed by a suprise 40<sup>th</sup>  birthday party for Balan Manian. Quite the surprise for Balan who could not even think that his family would attempt to have two parties in one day. Lots of work but credit goes to friends and family who helped with redecorating the hall. The highlight of the party was the dance choreographed by Sindhu with her siblings and friends for her uncle titled 'money money money'. All of his siblings, father and friends were present which made it special for Balan. Lots of dancing followed by a scrumptious Malayalee and Sri Lankan dinner.
