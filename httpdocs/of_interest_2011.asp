													<li><!--<img src="images/new.gif">--> The final event of the year, Pillayar Nonbu, was held at the Northwood Community Centre on Friday, Dec 30, 2011. This event was organized by Sathya and Kannan & Chitra and Annamalai. The event started off with bhajans perfomed by both kids and adults. Our President, V Pal provided an update on the organizations finances as well as gave a vote of thanks. Over 125 ezhais were distributed this year to Nagarathars from Canada, the US and India following which an auction (yelam) was held. As usual V Pal performed the role of the auctioneer. We collected over $10,000 this year. The collected monies will mainly be used to fund Nagarathar kids education in India. The event came to a close with some delicious traditional Chettinad potluck dinner prepared by our achis. Photos of this event have been posted to the 'Photos' section within this page.<br /><br />The CNS Executive Committee wishes all its members and Nagarathars all over the world a Happy New Year - 2012.</li>

													<li>The 2011 NSNA retreat was held from July 2nd to the 4th at the prestigious Patriots Theatre in Trenton New Jersey. The event garnered approximately 1200 attendees, who had the privilege to participate in and watch a variety of cultural programs, participate in debates, dances, game shows, and meditation sessions and reminisce with their family all across North America. The retreat offered a variety of activities and entertainment for individuals of all ages. Guests had the pleasure of having authentic and delicious Indian food during the event. <br /><br />The Canada Nagarathar Sangam members contributed to the entertainment at the event through the Kids Dance, Youth Dance and Adult Play. Alagu Viswanathan and Arthi Solaiappan danced to a medley of Indian songs. Their sharply controlled expressive movements along with their coordination, timing and energy were perfect. The Youth Dance, coordinated by Sindhu Suppiah, and danced by Sindhu, Lakshmee and Nandha was a true blast from the past, as it featured music from olden classics. The adult play followed the comic trials of the arrangement of a Chettiar marriage in the 1970s, accompanied by the appropriate music, costumes, set and comical characters. The play featured Anand, Annamalai, Balan, Banu, Chittu, Muthulakshmi, Unna, Valli, V Pal, Vasantha and Yegappan. The dance and skit were received extremely well by the audience! <br /><br />Subbu Lakshmanan and Arvind Ramanathan featured in a Youth skit. Subbu was later conferred the title of Mr. NSNA. Overall, the event was a complete success and we are looking forward to the next one in California! Photos and Videos of this event have been posted to the 'Photos & Video' section.</li>

													<li>We held our annual Mother's Day celebration on Saturday May 21st in Mississauga. The event began at 11:00 am, with over 60 members attending. The mother's entertained themselves with makeovers provided by the youth. They were treated to new hairstyles, manicures and henna. This youth initiative was able to fundraise $170 for the CNS Education Committee. This was followed by the kids and youth speaking about why their mothers are special. Additionally, this year, mothers and fathers also recollected memories of their mothers and discussed their importance. This was an emotional and special moment as families were able to truly appreciate and celebrate their mothers. As with our annual tradition, the fathers and kids cooked up some delicious food for the event. They even shared their recipes with the ladies who were blown away by the taste, presentation and attention to detail. Photos of this event have been posted to the 'Photos & Video' section.</li>
